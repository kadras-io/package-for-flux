# Unit Tests

The unit tests render the package with ytt and check the result, without a cluster. Run them with `task test:config`.

## Scenarios

Each folder is a scenario:

* `values.yml`: the package values to render with.
* `assert.yaml`: each document must match at least one rendered resource.
* `errors.yaml` (optional): no document may match any rendered resource.

The rendered manifests are also validated with kubeconform, against the Kubernetes schemas and, for custom resources, the schemas from the [CRDs catalog](https://github.com/datreeio/CRDs-catalog). Finally, `task docs:check` verifies that the README values table matches the values schema.

The documents in `assert.yaml` and `errors.yaml` use the [Chainsaw assertion syntax](https://kyverno.github.io/chainsaw/latest/quick-start/assertion-trees/), the same used by the cluster tests: partial resources, where the fields that are set must match, plus [JMESPath expressions](https://kyverno.github.io/chainsaw/latest/reference/jp/functions/) in parentheses.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: source-controller
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      priorityClassName: system-cluster-critical
      (containers[?name == 'manager'] | [0]):
        (contains(args, '--log-encoding=json')): true
        (args[?starts_with(@, '--events-addr')] | length(@)): 1
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: flux-crd-controller
(subjects[?namespace != 'flux-system'] | length(@)): 0
```

A document is compared with the rendered resources of the same `apiVersion` and `kind`, narrowed down by `metadata.name` and `metadata.namespace` when it sets them. In `errors.yaml`, a document with only `apiVersion` and `kind` means no resource of that kind at all.

The check is done by `hack/assert-render.sh`, which runs `chainsaw assert` on each candidate resource.

## Invalid values

Each file in `invalid` contains values the package must reject, and the expected error in its `# expected:` comment.
